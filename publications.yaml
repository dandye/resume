      Distributed applications use replication, implemented by protocols like
      Paxos, to ensure data availability and transparently mask server
      failures. This paper presents a new approach to achieving replication in
      the data center without the performance cost. Our work carefully divides
      the responsibility between the network layer and replication protocol.
      The network is responsible for ordering requests but not ensuring
      reliable delivery -- which we formalize as a new ordered unreliable
      multicast (OUM) model and show can be achieved with near-zero-cost in the
      data center. This guarantee enables our new replication protocol,
      Network-Ordered Paxos (NOPaxos), which exploits network ordering to
      provide strongly consistent replication without coordination. The
      resulting system not only simultaneously outperforms both latency- and
      throughput-optimized protocols on their respective metrics, it also
      provides throughput within 2\% and latency within 16 us of an
      unreplicated system -- providing replication without the performance
      cost.

    State machine replication is a technique used to guarantee the availability
    of a system even in the presence of faults. Agreement protocols are often
    used to implement state machine replication. However, the throughput of many
    agreement protocols, such as Paxos, does not scale with the number of
    machines available to the system. Systems whose throughput does scale often
    provide weaker consistency guarantees than state machine replication's
    linearizability. These weaker guarantees, such as eventual consistency, make
    the job of the application programmer much more difficult.

    Kapritsos and Junqueira previously proposed a protocol which uses an
    agreement protocol as a primitive and does scale. In this thesis, I describe
    my novel implementation of this protocol as well as the optimizations that
    were necessary to achieve scalability. The results of my experiments with
    this system show modest but promising evidence that the throughput of this
    system can, indeed, scale linearly with the number of machines.
